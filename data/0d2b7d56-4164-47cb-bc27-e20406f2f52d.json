Here, We have used popular deep-learning techniques like CNN and UNET. These techniques are \nwell suited for the detection of tumor in the MRI image. This segmentation method gives high accuracy as \ncompared to other methods. MRI images are best suitable for brain tumor detection.

  "questions": [
    "The job description mentions experience with React.js. Can you describe a project where you used React.js, detailing the specific challenges you faced and how you overcame them?",
    "Our team values collaboration. Describe a time you had to work closely with designers and backend developers to implement a new feature. What were the key communication strategies you used to ensure a smooth workflow and successful outcome?",
    "Based on your understanding of HTML, CSS, and your project experience, can you walk me through the steps you would take to optimize a web application for maximum speed and scalability, focusing on front-end considerations?"
  ],
  "answers": [
    "Sure! I built a dashboard using React.js to display real-time data. A key challenge was managing complex state across components. I solved it by implementing Redux for state management, which improved performance and made the codebase more maintainable.",
    "In a recent project, I worked with designers and backend developers to build a user profile feature. We used daily stand-ups, shared Figma designs, and Postman for API testing. Clear documentation and regular syncs helped ensure alignment and smooth delivery.",
    "To optimize front-end performance, I minify HTML/CSS/JS, use lazy loading for images, implement code-splitting in React, use efficient CSS (like Flexbox/Grid), and leverage browser caching. I also audit with tools like Lighthouse to find and fix bottlenecks.\n"

  "reasons": [
    "The answer is good, providing a specific project and challenge. The solution (Redux) is relevant and demonstrates understanding. However, it could be improved by adding more detail about the specifics of the data, the components involved, and the performance improvements achieved by using Redux. More details on the implementation and how it specifically addressed the performance/maintainability issues would elevate the answer.",
    "The answer is a bit generic and lacks depth. While it mentions tools and methods (stand-ups, Figma, Postman, documentation), it doesn't delve into *specific* communication challenges or innovative strategies used to overcome them. It also doesn't describe the *outcome* in detail.",
    "The answer touches on several key areas of front-end optimization, including minification, lazy loading, code-splitting, efficient CSS, and browser caching, and mentions Lighthouse. However, it lacks depth and specific examples. It's a good overview but could benefit from more detailed explanations of *how* these techniques are implemented and the specific benefits gained."
